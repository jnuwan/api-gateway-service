## Overview

The `api-gateway-service` is a demo application that implements an API Gateway using Spring Boot. It provides a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

## Features

- Routing client requests to various microservices.
- Load balancing.
- Circuit breaking.
- Rate limiting.
- Security features like authentication and authorization.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jnuwan/api-gateway-service.git
   cd api-gateway-service
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Configure your gateway settings in `application.properties`.

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the API Gateway, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the API Gateway is running, it will route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on the configuration in `application.properties`. Below is an example configuration for routing to a microservice:

```properties
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].id=product-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].uri=http://localhost:8081
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].predicates[0]=Path=/products/**
```
